## What are you hoping to find in your next position that would make us the right next step in your career?

One collaborative environment where I can learn with my colleagues and share my ideas. I know the company works strong with quality (tests), and it is something that I want to improve even more in my career.

## What have you learned so far about us that has excited you?

I understood that the team is open to suggesting new technologies, patterns, or anything that could bring value to the company or engineering team. The product is in a moment of defining patterns for the frontend, including design-system, framework, and architecture. Another thing I got excited about was the principles of developers, the company believes that all persons on the team are free to express their opinions about something.

## Have you worked in an environment where developers own delivering features all the way to production? We have QA (Quality Assurance) and a Product Operations team, however, they exist to provide support to engineers. Are you comfortable going to a place where the quality buck stops with the engineers and you have the ability to deploy and observe your own code in production?

Yes, in my last experience I worked in the same way, we also had QA to support the team, but the engineers were responsible to deploy code in production. I don't have a problem working together with QA or any professional quality, sometimes even with unit tests something passes wrong in usability, color, or logic.

## What is the next technology or subject you are hoping to learn about?

I want deep more into the React Universe, Next.js for example is a good framework to put attention to, I built my personal website using it, and the results are really nice!
