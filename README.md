# Petshop

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.1.0.

## Requirements

- [] Create login page
- [] Page to create a pet (image, name, status)
- [] Page to list all the pets for a given status. For each pet in the list display name, status
- [] When clicking on the pet in the list, the pet details should be displayed in a modal using Angular Material
- [] Implement a Redux pet state using NgXs (bonus)

**Please provide the code of the Angular app with relevant unit tests.**

## My plan

- Prototype (low fidelity) in Figma
- Lazy-loading modules
- Animations
- Unit tests
- Redux state ngrx (bonus)
- Create a service to access the API (docker running local)
- Design responsive
